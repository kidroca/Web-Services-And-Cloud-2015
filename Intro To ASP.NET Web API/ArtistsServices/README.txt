I was unable to finish the project in time
What remains is to implement the repository and create controllers for CRUD operations 
What is done:
1. Code First Database - Models + Migrations 
2. ResponseModels with Automapper and the automapper from ShowCase system
3. Removed Uneeded Files 
4. Default User Authentication
